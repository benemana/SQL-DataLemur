# SQL-DataLemur
My solutions to the most common SQL questions which show up in FAANG Data Scientist &amp; Data Analyst interviews, collected by DataLemur (https://datalemur.com/questions).

For solving these questions I used basic and advanced concepts of SQL language (GROUP BY, JOINS, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CTE, NESTED QUERIES, CASE EXPRESSIONS)
